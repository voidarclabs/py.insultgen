# Python insult generator

This python file will randomly generate an insult and use tts and say it.

To run, use `pip install gtts playsound` and run the [TTStest.py](https://github.com/voidarclabs/py.insultgen/blob/main/TTStest.py)file.

The insults are drawn from the .txt files and can be modified at will to add more words.
The `rude.insult()` function can still be called, but no longer requires the <num> variable.
If you do not need tts, use the [notts](https://github.com/voidarclabs/py.insultgen/blob/notts) branch.
